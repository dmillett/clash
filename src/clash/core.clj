  "DEPRECATED use (transform-lines)

  Load ~structured text from a file into a list of data structures to interact with
  at the command line (repl). Larger files and structures may require increasing the
   jvm heap. It helps to have specific regex to decrease the number of 'bad'
   structures included in the atomized data structure.

  Usage:
  (atomic-list-from-file \"/foo.log\" foo-parser)    ;; Attempt to load all
  (atomic-list-from-file \"foo.log\" foo-parser 50)  ;; Load first 50
  (atomic-list-from-file \"/foo.log\" is-foo? url-decode foo-parser -1) ;; Attempt to load all

  'input' - a text file with structure (typically a log file)
  'parser' - function that parses a text line, with regex, into a data structure
  'predicates'  - function includes/excludes text line from parsing
                - default will allow every line
                - define predicates with 'every-pred' for 1 - N predicates
  'transformer' - function to alter text line (decode, decrypt, etc) prior to parsing
                - defaults to no text transformation
  'max'         - Max number of solutions to load (possibly due to memory constraint)

   Alternatively, just the 2 arg function and rely on the parser to perform much of
   the functionality with more strict regex."

  'input' - An input stream handled with clojure.io.reader
  'parser' - Transforms & maps to a defined structure (or just transforms things like JSON, XML, etc)
  'tdfx' - A transducing function that transforms/maps data (default: (-> identity parser), ignores parser
  'max' - The maximum number of rows to transform
  'joinfx' - How to combine data in transduce, default (conj)
  'initv' - Initial value for transducer, default []

  produces:

  example:
